      <p>
        Cold Hands Collective was born out of a shared passion for grassroots
        Super Smash Bros. — both Ultimate and Melee — as well as a deep
        commitment to building an inclusive and thriving local community. The
        founders first crossed paths through Calgary's bustling tournament
        scene, where they discovered a mutual desire to create more accessible,
        consistent, and community-driven competitive spaces. Each member brought
        something different to the table—whether it was tournament organization
        experience, design and branding skills, tech know-how, or community
        outreach. This blend of talents led to the idea of forming an
        organization that could go beyond one-off events. The collective’s
        vision quickly solidified: to create a nonprofit dedicated to organizing
        high-quality Smash Bros. tournaments, fostering new talent, and
        supporting a welcoming environment for both casual and competitive
        players.

      <br />
      <p>
        In early 2024, the team entered the Bow Valley College Esports and Indie
        Dev. Accelerator program, where they refined their mission, developed
        strategic plans, and gained valuable mentorship in nonprofit
        development. The program was instrumental in helping Cold Hands
        Collective transition from a passionate idea into a formal organization.
        By the end of Winter 2024, Cold Hands Collective had officially
        incorporated, laying the groundwork for sustainable growth and long-term
        impact in Calgary’s scene. From day one, CHC has been about more than
        just games—it’s about connection, community, and creating something
        meaningful through play.
